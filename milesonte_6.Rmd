Milestone #6. Submit a PDF or html via Canvas. (I usually do everything in html until the very end of the process to avoid spending too much time fussing with annoying formating issues. We required you to submit that last two milestones in PDF in order to ensure that your computer was set up properly. The final submission will be in PDF.) 

In addition to the the elements from Milestone #5, your paper should include:

An Appendix in which you replicate all results — or all the important results — from your paper. As with other aspects of this project, the exact requirements will vary across students, depending on the complexity of your replication paper. If you paper only has 3 or 4 tables, we expect you to replicate it all. If it has 50 tables, we do not expect that. Use your best judgment and talk with us. ***You must replicate any result which you plan to use as the base of your extension.***

A clear statement about what aspects of the paper you were able to replicate and which parts, if any, you were not able to replicate.

500 words about your proposed extension. You do not have to have done the extension yet. (That comes next week.) But it is time to start thinking about what your contribution to human knowledge will be. You seek admission to the School of Athens. What do you have to offer us?

# Milestone 5 Components:
## Overview of Paper
My replication paper will be looking at Michael Barber and Jeremy C. Pope's paper, "Does Party Trump Ideologu? Disentangling Party and Ideology in America" which was published in the American Political Science Review in 2018. The paper tests whether citizens truly use their policy views to choose a partisan affiliation and if they see partisanship as more of a social identity. The paper asks: "how sincerely held are expressed political and policy opinions and are these opinions based on ideological convictions, or group loyalty?".^[1, Barber and Pope] The authors use Trump's unusual presidency to answer these questions. Since President Trump is both the leader of the GOP as well as a president that endorses both liberal and conservative views, the authors test the effect of Trump's political stances on voters' political stances. 

The authors' main hypothesis asserts that the influence of President Trump will demonstrate the existence of a large bloc of party loyalists in the electorate when his influence moves opinion in either a liberal or conservative direction based on his political cue. Those who are most likely to be party loyalists have a lack of knowledge about the party's traditional views and a lack of self-proclaimed "symbolic ideological commitment." Their null hypothesis is that Trump's cue haas no effect on subgroups. They have four specific hypotheses that fall under their main hypothesis:
 1. **Knowledge Hypothesis:** Only the those with less knowledge should react to the cue and behave as party loyalists presumably because the knowledgeable gain little from the treatment (political cue).
 2. **Partisan Hypothesis:** Strong paarty affiliates that share party with the cue-giver are more likely to be party loyalists.
 3. **Approval Hypothesis:** Those who approve of the cue-giver should be more likely to be party loyalists. 
 4. **Symbolic Ideology Hypothesis:** Self-described conservatives should hold firm to their presumed beliefs and are less likely to be party loyalists because they stick with their self-described policy tenets.

These hypotheses are tested by running a variety of regressions on data collected from surveys. Subjects were split into two groups, control and treatment, and asked about 10 political issues with clear partisan positions. The authors chose questions that capture policy issues in which Trump has taken either a conservative stance or a liberal stance. The control group was asked if they agree with a policy. The treatment group was asked if they agree with a policy after being prompted that Trump endorses this policy. Using this data, the authors ran regressions that explained subjects' support of policies using their partisanship, approval of the president, political knowledge, and symbolic ideology. The authors conclude that all of their hypotheses hold true except the symbolic ideology hypothesis. They found that people who most strongly described themselves as conservative most strongly answered the Trump cues (both liberal and conservative).

All analysis for this paper is available at my Git hub profile and the original data is available on Data verse. ^[https://github.com/carine-h/milestone_5, https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/38BFML]

#Table 1 - Regression Results
# In the table in the paper, the authors use the ordinary least squares regression model
# Support is for support of the policy

# These interaction models are used because people who strongly identify as conservative, for example, are more likely to be in the Republican party.
# Since I am trying to best replciate Table 1, I used the same regression components. I also kept the data parametes the same because these seem to be key in identifying which subjects we are looking at. I am still trying to find a way to better understand each variable (I may even email these authors) because there is no exhaustive list. To stay safe, I left the data parameters as they were.

# Interacting knowledge with political cues as well as key control variables:
# this model looks at the interaction between political knowledge and conservative/liberal cues
model1 <- lm(Support ~ libtrump*knowledge + contrump*knowledge + trump_approve

                     data = data[(data$contrump == 1 | data$self == 1 | data$libtrump == 1),])
# The outcome of Model 1 tells us that those with more political knwoledge are less likely to respond to liberal or conservative cues.

# Interacting party strength with political cues as well as key control variables:
model2 <- lm(Support ~ libtrump*party_strength + contrump*party_strength 
                     + knowledge + ideo5b + trump_approve + republican + race_white, 
# Here, the author chooses data for those with above-average partisanship. They also filtered for conservative Trump cues that were answered as well as liberal Trump cues that were answered. In this way, this regression looks at those who answered cues if there were any (?):

                                 & (data$contrump == 1 | data$self == 1 | data$libtrump == 1),])
# The outcome of Model 2 shows us that strong partisans are more likely to respond to Trump cues, whether liberal or conservative.

# Interacting Trump approval with political cues as well as key control variables:

# I want to recreate figure 1 in the paper using ggplot. Figure one looks at which groups respond to which cues by looking at the average answers for each of the 10 questions.

```
In these three plots, I demonstrate the effect of different political cues on different political groups in the study. In the paper, there is a graphic with this data however it combines nine models in one plot, making it quite difficult to decipher. I decided to split this plot up into three: one for each political group. Each graph looks at the increased probability of voting for liberal policies after receiving a conservative or liberal cue from President Trump as well as a conservative cue from GOP congressional leaders.

The first graph looks at the impact of these cues on Republicans' political tendencies. The plot shows that Republicans side more conservatively when they receive a conservative cue from Trump and side more liberally when they receive a liberal cue from Trump. There is a negligible effect from GOP congressional cues. 

The second graph looks at the impact of the cues on Democrats' political tendencies. It shows that when presented with a conservative cue from Trump, Democrats are less likely to vote liberally. When presented with a liberal cue, Democrats' political tendencies do not change. The same is true with a GOP congressional cue. 

The third graph looks at the impact of cues on Independents' political tendencies. In terms of magnitude change in probability of voting liberally, Independents show the least impact from all three cues. The conservative and liberal cues from Trump cause Independents to be more likely to vote liberally. The GOP congressional cue cause Independents to be slightly less likely to vote liberally.

# Replications Appendix
As mentioned above, this paper has a main hypothesis and four sub-hypotheses. The main hypothesis states that the influence of President Trump will demonstrate the existence of a large bloc of party loyalists in the electorate when his influence moves opinion in either a liberal or conservative direction based on his political cue. Those who are most likely to be party loyalists have a lack of knowledge about the party's traditional views and a lack of self-proclaimed "symbolic ideological commitment." Their null hypothesis is that Trump's cue has no effect on subgroups. These are the four sub-hypotheses:
 1. **Knowledge Hypothesis:** Only the those with less knowledge should react to the cue and behave as party loyalists presumably because the knowledgeable gain little from the treatment (political cue).
 2. **Partisan Hypothesis:** Strong paarty affiliates that share party with the cue-giver are more likely to be party loyalists.
 3. **Approval Hypothesis:** Those who approve of the cue-giver should be more likely to be party loyalists. 
 4. **Symbolic Ideology Hypothesis:** Self-described conservatives should hold firm to their presumed beliefs and are less likely to be party loyalists because they stick with their self-described policy tenets.
 
For my replication, I will look at a table with regressions for each of these hypotheses as well as five figures that plot the outcomes of these hypotheses.
